It won't run immiediately for you. It need some historical market data downloaded or an Interactive Broker TWS running on the node as well.
In addition to that, there are config settings which need to be setup first to be able to run this application:

cat config.ini 

[History directory]
history_dir = /Users/Uriel/Documents/Python/Ibis/historical/

[Test Dir]
test_dir = /Users/ + Username

[Server]
server_document = "http://localhost:5006/Bokeh_Gemini"

[IB]
IB_Server = 132.123.65.33


However, you can browse and check my codes in the scripts directory.
